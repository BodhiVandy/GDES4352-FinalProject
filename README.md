For my fi nal project, I intend to create a graphic design portfolio website that showcases my work across a variety of mediums, including illustrations, sketches, digital and traditional art, posters, iconography, typography, photography, and collage. This website will serve both as a professional portfolio and as a digital archive of my personal work and creative development over the years. The design will be visually engaging, with a clean layout that highlights my projects while ensuring ease of navigation. The portfolio will include high-quality (easily downloadable) images and detailed descriptions for each project, allowing visitors to understand both the creative process and the fi nal outcomes. The website will also be optimized for mobile and desktop users.
